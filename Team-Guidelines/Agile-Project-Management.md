# Overview

The ESS Monitoring team follows the Agile approach to software development which emphasizes incremental delivery, frequent inspection, team collaboration, continual planning, and continual learning.    We follow the Scrum framework for the specific roles, artifacts, and events within the team.

## Agile

The principles originally outlined in the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/) are first and foremost a mindset / cultural change to how the team organizes and operates to deliver value to end users.  Specifically, Agile values:
- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a plan

These values have become increasingly important in the era of increasingly complex systems that must be always-on and constantly improving.  A good starting point to Agile can be found on the [VSTS Agile site.](https://www.visualstudio.com/agile/)

## Scrum
[Scrum](https://www.visualstudio.com/learn/what-is-scrum/) is a popular Agile framework that defines specific artifacts, practices, and roles for self-organizing teams. One of the core aspects of scrum is a pre-defined lifecyle or iteration (usually called a sprint) in which the team collaborates closely to get work done and then inspects the work that was completed.  Scrum also defines a number of artifacts (e.g. product backlog), events (sprint planning, daily standup, etc), and roles (product owner, scrum master, etc).  Many of the of roles, events, and artifacts used by the ESS Monitoring team are largely taken / adapted from the [Scrum Guide](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html).

### Scrum Values and Principles

Scrum consists of three core principles and seven values.

**Principles**
1. Transparency - transparency across the team is essential to scrum in order to make work visible across the team, create shared understanding, and optimize processes.
2. Inspection - scrum focuses on frequent inspection of the backlog and work being performed, accomplished via regular events like sprint planning, retros, demos, etc.
3. Adaptation -adaptation is the natural response to inspection, allowing teams to course correct and make changes as new information becomes available.

Scrum also defines fives core values: **commitment, courage, focus, openness, and respect** which inform how the team should collaborate and hold eachother accountable.
