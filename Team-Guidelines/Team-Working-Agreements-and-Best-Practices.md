## TO do
- Backlog hierarchy https://www.visualstudio.com/learn/scale-agile-large-teams/
- User stories
Allows for Just-in-time approach (e.g. 2 sprints ahead)
Product manger -> who, what, why (problem)
Dev team -> how (solution)
Anyone can create them (not just PM!)
Can be easily prioritized in a backlog (again, usually 2 sprints ahead)
One way to describe requirements in agile
User-centric, written from perspective of user
Define problem statement, not the solution
Intended to start a conversation

The preferred user story structure used by the is:

>As a [user / persona]
>I want [task / action]
>so that [goal]

Intention of the user story is to capture the answer to three key questions:
1. **Who** is the user / persona facing the problem?
2. **What** specific task / thing are they trying to accomplish?
3. **Why**? What underlying outcome our goal do they want to achieve?

In some cases there will be technical user stories, architectural / enabler work, or other miscellaneous items that don't fit neatly into this template.  There's no need to force these types of stories into the above format - just make sure the user story is clearly defined and include enough level of detail for the team to understand the context and desired outcome.
- Estimation
- Acceptance criteria
- Common definition of done
