## Taxonomy
The team backlog follows the standard VSTS agile work item hierarchy of **Epic - Feature - User Story - Task**.  These categories can be fluid as the team learns over time or estimates the work required for certain work items.  For example a loosely defined user story that is added to the backlog may be refined and turned into a feature with several user stories over time.
- In general, work items that are at the top of the backlog (e.g. 1 - 2 sprints out) should be more defined.
- All work items should be linked to a parent, i.e. there should be no child (epic and below) work items without a parent.

|Work item|Description|
|---|---|
|Epic | Large scale initiatives or themes that span multiple releases, broken down into features|
|Features | Represent new functionality that is released to the customer, e.g. release unit (think what you would put into release notes)
|User Stories | Incremental value team must deliver to create a feature (can be delivered in single sprint)
|Tasks | Individual tasks required to complete a story|

## User Stories
User stories are a way of describing requirements in agile.  They are user-centric (written from the perspective of the end user) and clearly define the **problem statement** but do not define the solution or the "how" behind achieving the story.  Most importantly, user stories are intended to spark a conversation between all members of the team in order to create a shared understanding and context behind the user story.

As the core unit of both the product and sprint backlog, the **product manager** is typically responsible for creating user stores that clearly define the problem statement (who, what, why) and give the devops team enough context to define HOW they will solve this problem (i.e. the solution).  Although the product manager is accountable for the overall clarity and priority of user stories in the product backlog - ANYONE on the team is encouraged to create a user story.  If you have an idea for a new feature or a change we should make - **share it!**

The preferred user story structure used by the team is:

>As a [user / persona]
>I want [task / action]
>so that [goal]

Intention of the user story is to capture the answer to three key questions:
1. **Who** is the user / persona facing the problem?
2. **What** specific task / thing are they trying to accomplish?
3. **Why**? What underlying outcome our goal do they want to achieve?

In some cases there will be technical user stories, architectural / enabler work, or other miscellaneous items that don't fit neatly into this template.  There's no need to force these types of stories into the above format - just make sure the user story is clearly defined and include enough level of detail for the team to understand the context and desired outcome.
