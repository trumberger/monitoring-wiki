#Overview
The ESS Monitoring team is built on a foundation of Agile / Scrum and Devops practices.  This foundation drives a consistent and relentless focus on delivering value to our end users and a production first mindset.  In addition, Agile and Devops provide a framework for the values, principles, methods, practices, and tools that are used to achieve the teams  goals.
## Devops
The  concept of Devops has a number of definitions floating around, one of the better ones comes from [Sam Guckenheimer](https://www.visualstudio.com/learn/what-is-devops/) at Microsoft:

>  DevOps is the union of people, process, and products to enable continuous delivery of value to our end users. The contraction of “Dev” and “Ops” refers to replacing siloed Development and Operations to create multidisciplinary teams that now work together with shared and efficient practices and tools. Essential DevOps practices include agile planning, continuous integration, continuous delivery, and monitoring of applications.

Gene Kim, author of DevOps Handbook, talks about the [Three Ways](https://itrevolution.com/the-three-ways-principles-underpinning-devops/), which help frame the values and principles of Devops.  These mental models help us understand and assess both how we deliver value to our end users today and how we can improve.
1. The First Way, known as the principle of **flow**, is about the performance of the entire system.  The goal is to decrease the time from idea -> production deployment by understanding and optimizing how value flows through the system.
2. The Second Way, known as the principle of **feedback** is about creating ever-tighter feedback loops so that we continuously amplify our feedback loops and make corrections to continuously improve and eliminate defects upstream.
3. The Third Way, known as the principles of **continual learning and experimentation** are focused on developing a culture that fosters continual experimentation and learning from failure AND a team with a growth mindset.

These core principles inform a number of the more practices that people tend to associate with Devops, all of which are aimed at enabling the three ways, such as:
- [Continuous Integration](https://www.visualstudio.com/learn/what-is-continuous-integration/) - automating the build and testing of code each time a team member commits a change to version control.
- [Continuous Delivery](https://www.visualstudio.com/learn/what-is-continuous-delivery/) - build, test, configure, and deploying from a build to a production environment.
- [Automated Testing](https://devops.com/devops-continuous-testing/) - automating unit, integration, UI, and other tests automatically as part of the build or release process.
- [Monitoring](https://www.visualstudio.com/learn/what-is-monitoring/) - to provide real-time feedback from production on application performance and usage patterns.
- [Infrastructure as Code and Configuration Management](https://www.visualstudio.com/learn/what-is-infrastructure-as-code/) - managing infrastructure and configuration from version control.
