Create a System account using `Service-ID` with mailbox

RAW 
For your request it sounds like a System Account will need to be created so this can be completed. You can go to https://amtweb/ and request that a system account be set up. For your system account to be assigned a phone number, it will need to be login and email domain enabled, so please make sure you put that in your account add request to speed up the process.

Once you have an active alias, there will be a replication time for it to process through all of the necessary Microsoft systems. Please either respond to this email when that has completed or email the alias evhelp@microsoft.com  and include the system account alias and we can review to see if it is ready to be set up with a Enterprise Voice (EV) phone number.
