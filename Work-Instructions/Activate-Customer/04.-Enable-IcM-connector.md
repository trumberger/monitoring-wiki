#Overview
Within IcM the connector needs to be activated with an unique certificate.

#Activities
[Download](https://ssladminhre/) and open the certificate to local computer: Base64 Encoded (.cer).
[Install certificate](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/itweb/faq/identity/Pages/Installing-SSL-Certificates.aspx) on local machine (not user) in personal folder.
Export the certificate in MMC (All tasks -> Export) with Private Key on local machine. (see password below).
Remove certificate from local store, go to [Azure Key Vault](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#resource/subscriptions/16b26395-68e3-45e2-81c1-54729c26aba8/resourceGroups/SecureResources/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/KVL-PROD-Certificates/certificates) and **Add** certificate (see parameters below).
Go to [Add Connector](https://icm.ad.msft.net/imp/v3/administration/connectoronboarding) using parameters connector.

Store the Connector ID (GUID) that is created in [VSTS Library](https://easplatform.visualstudio.com/Monitoring/_library?itemType=VariableGroups):

- Create new Variable Group named: `{ServiceID}`
- Store connector ID as variable named: `CON-{ServiceID}`

Execute [PowerShell script](https://easplatform.visualstudio.com/_git/Monitoring?path=%2FBusinessLogic%2FAzureDeploy%2FPost-AddCustCertToVault.ps1) to create secrets in IcM Key Vault using parameters PowerShell Script
Upload certificate to [VSTS secure files](https://easplatform.visualstudio.com/Monitoring/_library?itemType=SecureFiles) from local disk: `C:\CERT-{ServiceID}.pfx`
Delete certificates files (.CER and .PFX) from local disk and certificate store 

#Notes
Use the same computer to create the certificate (step 3) and enable IcM connector (step 4).
