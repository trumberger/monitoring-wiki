## Overview
This section describes the creation of the service principles required for the monitoring platform. For each environment these steps need to be repeated. So if the customer has 2 production environments (US & Asia) and 1 UAT environment these steps need to be repeated 2 times. 

## Output
The output of these steps will create a number of Service Principles in the Azure AD tenant and assigns these principles to an Azure role. IDs and secrets are securely stored in a Key Vault. The following principles are created:

| Principle | Role | Mandatory | Certificate* | Purpose | Example | 
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|SPN-{environment}-LogAnalytics-{serviceID}| Read-only | Yes | No | This SPN is used to query the Log Analytics data store. | SPN-PROD-LogAnalytics-BPL-MON |
|SPN-{environment}-AppInsigths-{serviceID} | Read-only | Yes | No | This SPN is used to query the Application Insights data store(s). | SPN-STAG-AppInsigths-BPL-MON |
|SPN-{environment}-Kusto-{serviceID} | Read-only | No | No | This SPN is used to query the Kusto data store(s). | SPN-TEST-Kusto-CON-DASH |
|SPN-{environment}-Automation-{serviceID} | Contributor | Yes | Yes | This SPN is used to execute predefined runbooks by Azure Automation. | SPN-PROD-Automation-BPL-MON|
*Certificates are create as past of this section

## Prerequisites
In order to proceed, the following items need to be available or in place:
- List of environments (short names) need to be available.
- Is Kusto required for customers solution. 
- Key Vault name storing SPN details (contact ess-monitoring@microsoft.com)
- Service ID representing the service (contact ess-monitoring@microsoft.com)
- Temporary access to Key Vault (contact ess-monitoring@microsoft.com)
- Local Admin right on PC is required.
- Azure Owner permissions for targeted environments.  

## Activities
The following activities need to be performed:
- Download the latest version of the [SPN validation and creation script](src/Microsoft.EAS.Monitoring.Deployment.Platform/Pre-ValidateServicePrinciples.ps1).
- Open PowerShell console with elevated permission (Run as Administrator)
- Login to Azure using own Account: `Login-AzureRmAccount`

Perform for each environment:
- Select the subscription of that environment: `Select-RmSubscription -SubscriptionId {guid}`
- Execute scripts: `Pre-ValidateServicePrinciples.ps1 -keyVaultName {string} -environment {string} -serviceId {string} -kustoEnabled {bool}`
