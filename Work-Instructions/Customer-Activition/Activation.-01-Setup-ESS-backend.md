## Introduction
IcM uses Service Tree for all "tenants".  Tenants are logically part of Service Categories in IcM allowing teams to have multiple tenants per category.  Services (used interchangeably with tenants) are required to onboard to Service Tree.  The onboarding to Service Tree doesn't equal completion of onboading to IcM.  The Service Tree entry is entered and then sent to IcM for approval and provisioning.
