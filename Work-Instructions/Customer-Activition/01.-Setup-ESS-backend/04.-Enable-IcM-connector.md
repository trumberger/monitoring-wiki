#Overview
Within IcM the connector needs to be activated with an unique certificate.

#Activities
[Download](https://ssladminhre/) and open the certificate to local computer: Base64 Encoded (.cer).
[Install certificate](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/itweb/faq/identity/Pages/Installing-SSL-Certificates.aspx) on local machine (not user) in personal folder.
Export the certificate in MMC (All tasks -> Export) with Private Key on local machine. (see password below).
Remove certificate from local store, go to [Azure Key Vault](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#resource/subscriptions/16b26395-68e3-45e2-81c1-54729c26aba8/resourceGroups/SecureResources/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/KVL-PROD-Certificates/certificates) and **Add** certificate (see parameters below).
Go to [Add Connector](https://icm.ad.msft.net/imp/v3/administration/connectoronboarding) using parameters connector.
Add certificate thumbprint as user in [Manage Services](https://icm.ad.msft.net/imp/ManageTenants.aspx):

- Select the appropriate `{ServiceID}`
- Select Role: `Users - (All Clouds)`
- Within certificates add thumbprint and submit

Store the Connector ID (GUID) that is created in [VSTS Library](https://easplatform.visualstudio.com/Monitoring/_library?itemType=VariableGroups):

- Create new Variable Group named: `{ServiceID}`
- Store connector ID as variable named: `{ServiceID}-IcmConnector`
- Store Service ID as variable named: `{ServiceID}-ServiceID`
- Store Customer Name as variable named: `{ServiceID}-CustomerName`

TODO Add certificate as user

Use the same computer to create the certificate (step 3) and enable IcM connector (step 4).
