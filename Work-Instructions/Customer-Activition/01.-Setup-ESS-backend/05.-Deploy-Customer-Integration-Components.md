## Activities

Update [Release Definition](https://easplatform.visualstudio.com/Monitoring/_apps/hub/ms.vss-releaseManagement-web.cd-workflow-hub?definitionId=57&_a=definition-pipeline) named `Master -> Stag -> Prod release pipeline`  (**first** create a STAG Environment and if the deployment goes well, create PROD Environment)

**STAG Environment**
- Find the last existing **STAG - CI** Environment in the Pipeline and clone it. Rename it to "STAG - CI: `{ServiceID}`"
- In the Task List for the cloned Environment, ensure the Subscription selected is "ESS Monitoring Platform - **Staging**"
- In the variables tab:
	• Select "Variable Group" tab and link the `{ServiceID}` Variable Group (created earlier) to release pipeline.
	• When linking the Variable Group, ensure the Variable Group **Scope** is set to Environment (Radio button) and select the "STAG - CI: `{ServiceID}`" Environment created before.
	• Update the Scope for "Environment Settings - Staging" Variable Group to include the "STAG - CI: `{ServiceID}`" Environment created before.
- Go to Pre-Deployment Conditions for "**PROD - BL and CI: BPL-MON**" and update the Trigger to be "After Environment", then select the "STAG - CI: `{ServiceID}`" Environment created earlier.
