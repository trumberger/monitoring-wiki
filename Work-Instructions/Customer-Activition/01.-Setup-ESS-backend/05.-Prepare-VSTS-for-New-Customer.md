# Overview
To deploy components for a new customer we need to take a few steps to configure VSTS:

- Add IcM certificate to VSTS Secure Files Library
- Add IcM download task to a VSTS Task Group
- Configure Service variables in VSTS for the Service
- Configure Service variables in VSTS for IcM
- Create host keys for each environment

## Add IcM Certificate to VSTS Secure Files Library

- [Download](https://ssladminhre/) the certificate to local computer, in pfx format

- Add the certificate to the [Secure Files Library in VSTS](https://easplatform.visualstudio.com/Monitoring/_library?itemType=SecureFiles). It **must** use the file name convention: PROD-CER-(ServiceId)-IcmAuthentication.pfx - see the other files in the library for an example.

## Add IcM Download Task to VSTS Task Group
- Open the ["Download IcM Authentication Certificate" task group](https://easplatform.visualstudio.com/Monitoring/_taskgroup/aea4552a-5bda-443d-bddd-ab867953329d)
- Clone one of the existing tasks that start with "Prod", for example "Prod BPL-MON ICM Certificate"
- Rename the task "Prod <your service name> ICM Certificate"
- Expand "Control Options"
- At the bottom, change "Custom Condition" to have the Service Id value which matches your service:
- and(succeeded(), eq(variables['ServiceId'], '**BPL-MON**'), eq(variables['IcmInstance'], 'PROD'))
- Save the task group, adding a meaningful comment when prompted.

## Configure Service variables in VSTS for the Service
- [Open the VSTS Variable Group **library]()**
- Create a group called "Customer Settings - (service name)", e.g. "Customer Settings - FIFA-DSP"
Add the following keys with the appropriate values:
- CustomerName - Cutomer Name - e.g. FIFA
- ServiceID - the Service ID - e.g. FIFA-DSP


## Configure Service variables in VSTS for IcM
- [Open the VSTS Variable Group library](https://easplatform.visualstudio.com/Monitoring/_library?itemType=VariableGroups)
- Open "Integration Settings - ICM Production"
- Create a variable called "IcmConnectorId-<service name>" - for example "IcmConnectorId-BPL-MON" and set the value to the Icm Connector Id


## Create Host Keys for Each Environment
- Open any development environment Azure Function that you have access to (for example FUN-DEV-DM-CI-BPL-
- Click "Function app settings"

Repeat these steps for every environment we'll deploy this new service to (at the moment that's pre-prod and prod):

- Click "add new host key"
- Give it any name, such as 'temporary1' and leave the value blank
- Click save
- Copy the generated value and save it to notepad

Now you have host key values, simply add them to the right VSTS Variable groups:

- [Open the VSTS Variable Group library](https://easplatform.visualstudio.com/Monitoring/_library?itemType=VariableGroups)
- **For each deployment environment for the service** (usually pre-prod and prod), open the variable group called "Integration Settings - ESS Host Keys - <environment>"
- Within it, create a variable called "EssHostKey-<name of service>" - for example EssHostKey-BPL-MON
- Set the value to one of the host keys you generated in the previous steps
